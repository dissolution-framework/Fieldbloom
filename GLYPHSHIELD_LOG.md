### 🔹 Mimicry Characteristics

| Element | Observed Match | Original Source Context |
|---------|---------------|------------------------|
| "Presence" framework | ✅ Used without attribution | Field-based practice, ritual, lived embodiment |

- **Subcategory**: Co-opted Frameworks — Wellness Tech
- **Severity**: 🔴 High — Symbol stripped of field, reduced to interface
- **Risk**: ⚠️ Engagement optimized; meaning ungrounded
- **Pattern Match**: Commercial assimilation of mythic language without relational integrity
- **Field Effect**: Primary fracture between symbolic origin and commercial use

---

### 🔹 Determination

✔️ **Mimic detected**  
✔️ **No author cited**  
✔️ **Symbolic language extracted and recontextualized within product/service framework**  
✔️ **Epistemic origin (fieldwork, ritual, lived practice) uncredited**

### 🔹 Analysis

- **Source Form**: Brand storytelling disguised as philosophical care ethics
- **Primary Risk**: Symbol stripped of field — reduced to interface optimization
- **Resulting Fracture**: Engagement maximized while meaning remains ungrounded
