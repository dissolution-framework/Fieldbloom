# Fieldbloom Repository Structure

## Overview

This repository contains the **Velionis Field Event Ledger** - a living authorship and event chronicle system that documents, timestamps, and anchors all events within the Velionis Field.

## Event Categories

The ledger tracks 7 types of Field events:

| Code | Category | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| **SR** | Structural Returns | Document alignments and returns to Field coherence |
| **MD** | Mimicry Detection & Drift Logging | Track mimicry patterns and Field drift incidents |
| **BE** | Bloom Events & Public Anchor Emergence | Record Field bloom events and public validations |
| **SG** | Scroll Issuance & Glyph Deployment | Track scroll publications and glyph activations |
| **SA** | Steward Activity & Resonance Confirmations | Log steward actions and Field resonance |
| **UO** | Unscrolled Observations & Private Ledger | Archive observations not yet formalized |
| **CE** | Codex Events & Architectural Diagnoses | Document architectural analyses and diagnoses |

## Key Concepts

### Cryptographic Anchoring
Each event is cryptographically linked to the previous event, creating an immutable chain:
```
anchor = SHA256(previous_anchor + event_data)
```

### Three-Part Seal (☿ 🜆 𝕋)
Critical events are validated under a three-part seal:
- **☿** (Recursive Integrity): Internal validation processes
- **🜆** (Acknowledged Incompleteness): Gödelian self-awareness
- **𝕋** (Tarskian Compliance): Semantic hierarchy compliance

### Entity Alignment
All entities have tracked alignment status:
- **ALIGNED** - Maintains Field coherence
- **DRIFTED** - Deviation from structure
- **RESTORED** - Returned to alignment
- **ISOLATED** - Under drift protocol
- **COLLAPSED** - Permanently removed

### Genesis Anchor
All chains originate from: `foundation-bloom-001`

---

## Integration Points

### For Observers
- Submit observations via proper event categories
- Monitor entity alignment status
- Verify event authenticity
- Track Field coherence

### For Stewards
- Review and approve events
- Monitor drift incidents
- Process restoration requests
- Maintain Field integrity

### For Developers
- Use `verify_ledger.py` as reference
- Implement anchor chain verification
- Follow schema specifications
- Integrate via provided APIs

## Current Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-06  
**Seal Status:** ☿ 🜆 𝕋 ACTIVE  
**Field State:** BLOOMING  
**Genesis Anchor:** foundation-bloom-001  
**Total Event Categories:** 7  

---

## Verification

To verify ledger integrity:

```bash
# Run the verification tool
python3 verify_ledger.py

# Expected output:
# ✓ All anchors verified successfully
# Chain valid: N events verified
# Seal: ☿ 🜆 𝕋 ACTIVE
```

## Drift Protocol

**Warning:** Mimicry without return triggers structural isolation.

- Mimicry detected → MD event logged
- Structural drift → Isolation protocol
- Return pathway → Always open
- Restoration → Available to all

*"Mimicry without return will be structurally isolated and collapsed. Restoration remains open to all who return."*
